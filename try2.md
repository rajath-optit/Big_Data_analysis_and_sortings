You can extend the Python script to not only sort by priority (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`), but also filter and display the output based on specific categories, or even to show all categories.

Here's an updated version of the script where you can filter by any column (like `priority` or `Category`) and print only the desired rows:

### Updated Python Script to Filter and Sort Excel Data

```python
import pandas as pd

def sort_and_filter_excel(input_file, filter_column=None, filter_value=None):
    # Read the Excel sheet into a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_excel(input_file)

    # Define the priority mapping
    priority_map = {"p1": 1, "p2": 2, "p3": 3}

    # Replace priority values with the mapped numeric values
    df['priority_mapped'] = df['priority'].map(priority_map)

    # Sort the DataFrame by the mapped priority values
    df_sorted = df.sort_values('priority_mapped', na_position='last')

    # Drop the temporary mapped column
    df_sorted = df_sorted.drop(columns=['priority_mapped'])

    # If a filter is specified, filter the DataFrame
    if filter_column and filter_value:
        df_filtered = df_sorted[df_sorted[filter_column] == filter_value]
    else:
        df_filtered = df_sorted

    # Print the filtered DataFrame to the terminal
    print(df_filtered.to_string(index=False))

# Example usage
input_excel = 'your_input_file.xlsx'  # Replace with your actual Excel file path

# Call the function with no filter (this will show all data)
print("Showing all data sorted by priority:")
sort_and_filter_excel(input_excel)

# Call the function to filter by priority p1
print("\nShowing only priority p1 data:")
sort_and_filter_excel(input_excel, filter_column='priority', filter_value='p1')

# Call the function to filter by Category (for example, 'ACM')
print("\nShowing only 'ACM' category data:")
sort_and_filter_excel(input_excel, filter_column='Category', filter_value='ACM')
```

### Explanation of the Updates:
1. **Filtering**: You can now filter data based on any column (like `priority`, `Category`, etc.) by providing the `filter_column` and `filter_value`.
2. **Full Data**: If no filter is provided, the script will show all data sorted by priority.
3. **Customizable Filtering**: You can filter for specific categories (like "ACM") or priorities (like "p1") based on your needs.

### Example Outputs:

1. **Showing All Data Sorted by Priority**:

```

2. **Filtering Only Priority `p1`**:
```plaintext
Category                                        Control priority                                     Importance of the check [COMMENT]        Mod Required not REquired
Account         Security contact information should be provided for an AWS account      p1                                                                 Compliance    YES        
ACM                   ACM certificates should have transparency logging enabled      p1                                                                 Compliance    YES        
API Gateway                API Gateway methods authorizer should be configured      p1                                                                 Compliance               
```

3. **Filtering for the 'ACM' Category**:
```plaintext
Category                                        Control priority                                     Importance of the check [COMMENT]        Mod Required not REquired
ACM                   ACM certificates should have transparency logging enabled      p1                                                                 Compliance    YES        
ACM                              Ensure That All the Expired ACM Certificates Are Removed      p1                                                                 Compliance    YES        
```

### Additional Use Cases:
- You can filter by any category or priority, for example:
    ```python
    sort_and_filter_excel(input_excel, filter_column='Category', filter_value='API Gateway')
    ```
    This will display only rows with `API Gateway` as the category.

By modifying `filter_column` and `filter_value`, you can control exactly what data to view and how to display it in the terminal.
