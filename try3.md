To achieve this, you can create a Python program that processes the Excel data and allows you to filter and sort based on various categories, priorities, or any other headings you want. You can think of this program as an interactive search tool where you can specify conditions (e.g., priority and category) and get the filtered results.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to how you can implement this:

### 1. Install Necessary Libraries
First, you'll need to install `pandas` to handle and manipulate your Excel or CSV data. You can install it using pip if you don’t already have it installed:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### 2. Program Overview
- Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame from your Excel or CSV file.
- Create an interactive prompt where the user can specify search conditions (e.g., “list all p1 from CloudFront”).
- Filter and display the data based on the user's input.

### 3. Example Python Program

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from an Excel or CSV file
def load_data(file_path):
    return pd.read_csv(file_path)  # Use pd.read_excel if your file is in Excel format

# Function to filter based on category and priority
def filter_data(df, category=None, priority=None):
    if category:
        df = df[df['Category'].str.contains(category, case=False)]
    if priority:
        df = df[df['priority'].str.lower() == priority.lower()]
    
    return df

# Function to display filtered data
def display_filtered_data(df):
    if not df.empty:
        print("\nFiltered Data:")
        print(df[['Category', 'Control', 'priority', 'Mod']])
    else:
        print("No matching results found.")

# Main interactive function
def interactive_filter(df):
    print("Welcome to the Search Engine!")
    while True:
        print("\nEnter the category and priority you want to filter (e.g., 'CloudFront p1').")
        print("Type 'exit' to quit.")
        
        user_input = input("Enter search (format: 'Category Priority'): ").strip().lower()
        
        if user_input == 'exit':
            print("Exiting...")
            break
        
        # Split input to get category and priority
        try:
            category, priority = user_input.split()
            filtered_df = filter_data(df, category=category, priority=priority)
            display_filtered_data(filtered_df)
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid input in the format 'Category Priority'.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

# Load the data file
file_path = 'example_data.csv'  # Replace with the path to your actual file
df = load_data(file_path)

# Start the interactive filtering
interactive_filter(df)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Data Loading**:
   - The `load_data` function loads the Excel or CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
   
2. **Filtering**:
   - The `filter_data` function allows you to filter the data based on the category (e.g., `CloudFront`) and priority (e.g., `p1`). 
   - It checks for both the category and priority, returning only the rows that match your criteria.

3. **Interactive Search**:
   - The `interactive_filter` function is the heart of the program. It continuously prompts you for input and filters the data based on your search conditions. You can type a combination like `CloudFront p1`, and it will return all `p1` priority controls under the `CloudFront` category.
   
4. **User Input**:
   - It prompts the user for input in the format `Category Priority` and uses that to filter the DataFrame.

5. **Output**:
   - The filtered results are displayed with only the relevant columns (`Category`, `Control`, `priority`, and `Mod`).

### Example Output

If you input:
```
CloudFront p1
```

The output will be:
```
Filtered Data:
     Category                                             Control priority        Mod
CloudFront      CloudFront distributions should encrypt traffic      p1   Compliance
CloudFront      CloudFront distributions should have latest TLS      p1   Compliance
```

### 4. How to Run
1. Save the above code to a `.py` file.
2. Ensure your Excel/CSV file is in the same directory or specify the correct file path in the `file_path` variable.
3. Run the Python script, and it will prompt you to enter the category and priority you want to filter by.

### Enhancements
- You can expand this to handle more complex filters, such as multiple priorities or categories.
- You can also add error handling for cases where the input format is incorrect or if the category/priority doesn’t exist in the data.
